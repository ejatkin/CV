## Elizabeth Atkin

I left the civil service to pursue a long-standing interest in all things digital. I wanted to see where my enthusiasm would take me and it led me to Makers Academy - Europe’s \#1 developer bootcamp. I’m excited to see where it will lead me next: hopefully to a full-stack junior developer role where I can also gain experience in product management and business strategy.

## Skills

Learning software development has changed my life. It has given me (at least) three powers...

####Premonition / the power of “yet”
I’m referring to [Carol Dweck’s TED talk](https://www.ted.com/talks/carol_dweck_the_power_of_believing_that_you_can_improve). There are many, many things in software development that I don’t know or can’t do. Yet. But I am looking forward to those challenges and believe that I am equipped with the tools, skills and tenacity required to solve them.

####Investigation / the power of “why”
Software development has brought out my latent curiosity: why does this work, what if I try this, what does that mean? But it has also taught me to ask better questions and to ask them only after I've spent time looking into the issue. In refining my questions, I sometimes even get to the solution as part of the process. But even if I don’t, the process of researching possible solutions and looking at the different ways other people have approached the problem have all helped me to write the clearest and most concise solution I possibly can.

####Empathy / the power of “being positive”
I have found software development enjoyable in a way I never expected and in a number of unlikely places: stack traces, databases, a book called “The Well-Grounded Rubyist”. I would like to share that enthusiasm and find the most positive way of working with people. I want to come up with positive, constructive ways of doing thing better and I want the chance to grow and learn from my mistakes.

####And also some coding...
My tech skills include: Ruby, Rails, Sinatra, Node.js, Express, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, Bootstrap, PostgreSQL.
